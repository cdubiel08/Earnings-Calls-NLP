Rodney Sacks
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I am Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President is with me; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance.
As you may have already noticed, my voice is soft today. That’s because I recently had a benign polyp removed from my larynx. The good news is that I am fine. But I have been advised to use my voice sparingly. So I will save my voice for the Q&A and hand the call over to Hilton.
Hilton Schlosberg
Thank you. Tom Kelly is going to ready the Safe Harbor statement before we start the call.

Thank you, Tom. We again to turn out to the quarter and we will move on from there. Consumer beverage preferences and tastes continue to evolve at an increasing pace. And we are endeavoring to address them through our ongoing innovation of new products.
In the third quarter of 2019 net sales were $1.13 billion up 11.6% from $1.02 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Net sales for the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $12.2 million of foreign currency movements. Without these foreign currency movements, net sales for the quarter would have been up 12.8%.
The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales of advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States in of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 14.6%.
Turning now to gross profit, gross profit as a percentage of sales for the 2019 third quarter was 59.4%, compared with 59.8% in the 2018 third quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2019 third quarter was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix. Such decrease was partially offset by price increases, as well as reduced input costs.
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.3% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 4.1% in the 2018 third quarter.
Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.2% in the same quarter in 2018.
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 10.1% for the 2019 third quarter, as compared to 11.1% in the same quarter in 2018.
In the quarter, payroll expenses as a percentage of net sales was 6.5%, compared to 6.2% in the same period in 2018. Payroll costs increased $10.4 million, primarily due to headcount growth, both domestically and internationally. Stock-based compensation and non-cash item were $16 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $14.1 million in the same quarter in 2018.
Our effective tax rate increased from 21.8% in 2018 third quarter to 25% in the 2019 third quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, as well as the decrease in the equity compensation deduction. In addition, the comparative effective tax rate for the 2018 third quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit.
Net income was $298.9 million in the 2019 third quarter, compared to net income of $267.7 million in the 2018 third quarter, an increase of 11.6%.
Diluted earnings per share for the 2019 third quarter increased 14% to $0.55 from $0.48 in the third quarter of 2018.
Now we turn to The Coca-Cola Company transition update. In the third quarter of 2019 Monster Energy was launched by or transition to coke bottlers in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. We are planning further international launches later this year.
We launched Predator, our affordable energy brand in the third quarter of 2019 in Botswana and in Slovakia. We are planning to launch Predator in selected additional markets in Eastern Europe and Africa in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In China, we completed the rollout of both Monster Ultra Violet and Monster Mango in the third quarter. We have significantly expanded our shelf space for Monster with these three SKUs in our targeted top 40 cities and key accounts.
We continue to roll out a Monster across India and began the launch of Ultra Violet into approximately 20% of our accounts in September. We will continue Ultra’s expansion into the fourth quarter, as well as commencing the launch Mango Loco to leverage consumer taste preferences in India. 
I will now briefly discuss a litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. Monster filed a lawsuit against VPX in September 2018 for false advertising and VPX filed a trademark lawsuit against Monster in relation to our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in March 2019. Both proceedings are ongoing.
In August 2019, VPX filed another lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, alleging a host of legal challenges, including many similar to the claims Monster alleged against VPX. Monster will seek the dismissal of VPX’s most recent lawsuit.
In October 2019, U.S. Court, the US District Court for the Southern District denied VPX’s motion for preliminary injunction against Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in its trademark lawsuit. In his decision, the Court ruled that VPX fail to meet any of the elements of a preliminary injunction and failed to establish that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims.
The VPX recently announced an intention to launch its own Reign -- own line of Reign branded energy drinks in 16 ounce cans to be sold in convenience stores. We recently filed an expedited motion for preliminary injunction asking the court to stop this product launch and to prevent VPX from infringing Monster’s trademark rights in this way.
In one of the Court findings in May 2019, we stated that sales of Reign beverages from June to December 2019 were projected to exceed $235 million. Our sales of Reign through October was solid, as illustrated by the Nielsen numbers were lower than our initial expectations.
As with any new product launches, sales may be affected by many factors, including retail authorizations, the dates on which listings are secured for products with major retailers and introductions of new flavors. The company has not changed its practice with respect to projections and will not be providing projections with respect to Reign or any other products.
As our litigation with VPX is subjugated, we will not be answering questions on this matter on today’s call.
Now we are going to turn to the Nielsen reports in North America. According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through October 26, 2019 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots increased by 9.1% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of our Monster -- of Java Monster alone were 9.6% higher than in the same period the previous year.

Amp and affordable energy brand launched in March increased its market share to 8.7% in the month of September 2019.
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.
Now I would turn to EMEA, I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be use as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country-to-country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country-to-country.
According to Nielsen the 13 weeks ended October 5, 2019, Monster’s retail market share in value as compared to the same period of previous year grew from 12.3% to 12.9% in Belgium, from 23.3% to 27.6% in France, from 20.9% to 21.5% in Great Britain, from 7.1% to 7.2% in the Netherlands, from 18.0% to 23.7% in Norway, and from 30.3% to 33.4% in Spain.

We again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or four-week period may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.
So, now we are going to turn to sales and the segments. Net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the third quarter of 2019, which include Reign increased 13.5% from $935.1 million to $1.06 billion from the comparable period in 2018.

The comparative net sales in the 2018 third quarter included approximately $16 million in net sales with advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States by uncertain about products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movement net sales for the Monster Energy Drinks segment for the 2019 third quarter would have been up 16.6%.

Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $12.2 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company’s military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and trans-shipped to the military and their customers overseas.
Now, we turn to sales in EMEA, in EMEA supply chain and production issues have largely been resolved. In EMEA net sales in the third quarter increased 34.1% in dollars and increased 40.1% in local currencies over the same period in 2018.
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.3%, compared to 41.3% in the same quarter in 2018. Gross profit percentage for the region was impacted by country and product mix, as well as increases in manufacturing costs.

Now turning to balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $717.6 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $637.5 million at December 31, 2018. Short-term investments were $597.4 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $320.7 million at December 31, 2018. Net accounts receivable increased to $648 million at September 30, 2019 from $484.6 million at December 31, 2018.
Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 44.6 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 41.4 days at December 31, 2018. Inventories increased to $317.7 million at September 30, 2019 from $277.7 million at December 31, 2018. Average days of inventory were 62.1 days at September 30, 2019, compared to 67.2 days at December 31, 2018.
Now we can talk a little about October 2019 gross sales. We estimate October 2019 gross sales to be approximately 7.3% higher than in October 2018. On a foreign currency adjusted basis, October 2019 gross sales would have been approximately 8.6% higher than comparable October 2018 gross sales.
The comparative gross sales in October 2018 included advanced purchases as a result of the price increase in the United States on certain of our products effective November 1, 2018. Adjusting for these advanced purchases and foreign currency movements, we estimate gross sales for the month of October 2019 would have been approximately 14.6% higher than in October 2018. 
In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period, often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distribute incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers, as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons.
We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month or even two months should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.
Share repurchase programs, during the 2019 third quarter the company purchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $58.60 per share, for a total of $254.3 million excluding broker commissions.
As of November 6, 2019, approximately $36.6 million remains available for -- US$36.6 million remains available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. On November 6, 2019, the company’s Board of Directors authorize a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock.
In conclusion, I’d like to summarize some recent positive points. Retail sales statistics for many countries around the world demonstrate that the energy category is continuing to grow and then Monster is generally going ahead of the category in line with the earlier periods.
Number two, the new additions to the Monster family continue to add the company’s sales. 
Number three, we are excited about the prospects for our brands and our new product launches this year, as well as our innovation pipeline in 2024.
Fourthly, we are encouraged by the prospects for Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks, not only within the U.S. but looking further abroad.
Number five, we are pleased with our growth and performance in our international markets. Net sales in the third quarter in EMEA increased 40.1% in local currency, in Asia-Pacific increased 43.4% in local currency and in Latin America and the Caribbean increased 51% in local currency. We reiterated the growth potential for us in China and India.
And lastly, we are proceeding with our plans for future launches of Affordable Energy Drink brands internationally. We also proceeding with our plans for the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.
I’d like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrea Teixeira
Thank you all, and Rodney, I wish you a fast recovery. And so you can help us with the positioning of the core Monster, which I understand correct, if I understand correctly was down 2.4% in all outlets and declined 5% in convenience. Do you believe that is related to the promotional environment of your main competitor or just a function of Reign gaining more shelf space? And how are you planning to react to that? Will you feel the need for more promotion for to become more promotion as well or you are just happy with the total performance? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks
Well, I will take that. Forgive of my vocal. Just I think that if you look at the category, what we have noticed is you have had an impact on all of the -- pretty much on all of the SKUs that are had been existing in the market over the past couple of months. You are seeing the increases coming from us and our main competitor coming from new products.
So -- but -- if you look at the total category, the total category remains healthy. It’s up 9%, which is really good growth. So the category is growing. It’s been a shift within the category. We -- you have got to look at brands and whatever we have in the category. So you look at the fact that we are down or some of the individually SKUs are down. But overall, the category is growing, our overall corporate sales are growing, we would address obviously individual SKUs. 
And I think this is an experience that’s being experienced by general consumer products for established brands. There is a movement generally on consumers to want to try new products, new flavors, new innovation. And we do have a new innovation, which we -- some of that we have announced we recently launched. We have plans to launch quite a lot of new innovation. I think that in some cases, some of our new innovation that we launched earlier this year, perhaps, didn’t get enough shelf space or there have been some shelf space taken from our existing product, which I think has affected sales.
So looking at one of the sort of main things I think we will look at going forward is improving the quality of our distribution, getting out innovation more efficiently and more effectively on the shelves And as we go forward, we believe there will be additional space allocated to the performance energy category, which will relieve pressure on the space we are looking for our existing energy brands and the innovation under the Monster line.
Hilton Schlosberg
So just to add to what Rodney is saying, if you asked, if we are happy with the way things are, and obviously, we are not. We want to see the Monster brand growing. What we have evidence of is that the price increase has stuck. And when you will get our Q tomorrow and you can even see it, I think, in the release, that the promotional allowances are very much in line with where they should be and we are not over promoting.
Having said that, I just want to reiterate that the category if you look back 52 weeks, the energy category has shown incremental growth per Nielsen of $1.3 billion. So this is a growing category and it’s a category that now has a new segment, which is performance energy and performance energy is growing within that category.
And, as I look at some of our other competitors, and this is no defense, but as we look for example, even at Red Bull, which is growing and we mentioned on the call that it’s growing. The Red Bull core brands also not showing growth. The diet SKUs are and their additions are, but in general the Red Bull core brands are also not showing growth and are in decline. Having said that, we have got plans with our distribution, which has been a challenge to dramatically improve distribution and distribution on shelf and in the coolers.
Rodney Sacks
Perhaps there’s just one other aspect I’d like to add to that, this is sort of broad view. These comments we have made really focus on the U.S. and the US has been our major market. But as we develop as a company, the opportunity for us for our energy brands Monster in particular plus our other brands is international.
And if you look at the information we just gave on this call about how we have accelerated international growth in existing international markets and new markets, that’s where we look to in the future for the company.
Our sales as we -- U.S. was about 72% of our sales last year this quarter and it’s now down to 67. So if you take that with as a growth position, it’s going to continue to grow. So we see a lot of run way to grow internationally, to grow the brand and these markets are continuing to grow and are very healthy.
So, we need to address challenges we have in the U.S. at the moment. But, overall, we still believe in the health and we still believe in the growth of the brand both internationally and even in -- within the U.S. as well in our other energy brands.
Hilton Schlosberg
And then one thing we really should -- turning back a few years for a moment, sorry. The one thing we really should not forget about is the unmeasured channels, which we have been absolutely emphatic about, our Food Service is unmeasured, Amazon is unmeasured, Costco is unmeasured, and a slew of other Home Depot and Lowes all of those channels are unmeasured. And the amount of sales that are going through those channels is really -- is a significant number. 
Rodney Sacks
Thanks.
Andrea Teixeira
Thank you both. 
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve Powers
Yes. Thank you. Maybe a little bit more on the U.S. Can you talk about growth in the quarter coming in a touch below 3% versus the Nielsen data over the course of the quarter pointing closer to 6%? I think we all know you had tough comparisons in the year ago quarter, but at the same time, there was an extra selling day this quarter. And so just how do you think about that 3% number in light of those factors, building on Andrea’s question? And then if I could related question, building on what you just said, but in the context of Coke Energy, and I think, that we all appreciate what you and Coke have each said about the intended interplay between Monster and really Monster and Reign and Coke energy and that they are targeted different consumers and designed to minimize cannibalization risk, but given that they will be going through common distributors, just how confident are you that those new Coke SKUs won’t take away from some of your smaller SKU use whether Monster Reign, NOS, Full Throttle or otherwise, rather than having them successfully fine incremental space in the cooler or take away from competition distributed by others? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg
So let me start with your first question. When you look at Nielsen and you look at our own financial numbers, you cannot draw an exact interpolation from one to the other. Nielsen sales out, our sales are sells to the distributors, the bottlers. We have a SKU of unmeasured channels that I mentioned. And while it’s a good indication of what’s of the movement of sales, it’s not an absolute science and one has to be very wary, but we have said this on many calls in the past, I am going to be very careful trying to balance our sales to our bottlers and our distributors with sales out to the consumer.
Nielsen read a sample. They don’t read all the channels. They don’t read, as I said, the Food Service, they don’t read Amazon, they don’t read Costco. They don’t read the Home Depot’s and the Lowe’s and all the other channels where our products are distributed. So it’s difficult to draw a comparison from one to the other. All we can do is give you the facts and you guys make your own assessments from there.
Rodney Sacks
Now as regards to Coke Energy. I think that most of the analysts are very up-to-date and astute on analyzing Nielsen well. They should be looking and analyzing Nielsen around the world and that would give everybody their own view on what’s been happening with the rollout of Coke Energy around the world.
We have seen the brand rollout and we have also seen the rate of sale, not keeping pace with initial sales, the percentage market share has been small and hasn’t really had an impact on us. The main impact that I think we will repeatedly said is that we did have concerns or is the sort of noise and in the market and focus from divergence of focus. But ultimately, in Europe, things are settling down, our growth rates of our brands are on track and have continued.
And I think that by and large, the Coke system has pretty much focused on not trying to cannibalize our existing products and take pricing from us and it has worked reasonably well. There have been a few countries where there have been some challenges and we have addressed them.
So, again, we don’t know, we can’t tell what Coke Energy will be in the United States. It’s formulated little differently. It’s a little different in sizes. There are two variants. But, ultimately, we think that, we just need to manage the lack of focus or conflict of focusing from to bottlers. Ultimately, we don’t think it will have a major impact on our brand and we will manage it and going forward how you feel.
Hilton Schlosberg
Yeah. I mean, what I would do if I were an analyst, I would get the information from the markets in which they have launched and there are a number of them. And frankly, they have not -- the numbers that I have seen and I can’t talk for numbers that other people may have seen. The numbers that I have seen are showing that they have not performed particularly well and that our brands have continued to grow and our brands have continued to develop in those markets. But get the homework.
Rodney Sacks
We don’t know what the U.S. will be, it’s own market. And so we will see how things go and we will manage it.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Mark Astrachan
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. And Tom, good to hear from you on the call today.
Tom Kelly
Thank you, Mark.
Mark Astrachan
There it is again. So, I guess, I wanted to ask about gross margin. International continues to be a bit of a sore spot there. U.S. again continued to be pretty good. So you touched on some of the supply chain issues and EMEA having been resolved and kind of talking directionally to stabilization or at least that’s maybe my interpretation of it. LatAm was obviously flat in gross margin. So is the worst behind you at this point. You have anymore visibility on that, I am not asking for guidance. I love a personal point of view, kind of how we should all think about that since I think it’s one of those areas that is a bit more of a black box than others. So any help there would be a appreciate it?
Hilton Schlosberg
It’s not really a black box. I mean, we sell concentrates at high margins and through the strategic brands. And we sell finished products at different margins that really are a base for a number of factors on the relationships we have developed with the bottlers and distributors in various countries and the cost of production.
So it’s always every quarter the issue is how much do we sell internationally, which has low margins and I will get on to that, and I think, I have discussed it on a previous call. And how much strategic brands did we sell as a cooperation versus finished goods at Monster Energy.
So when we established a model in the United States, the distributors were allocated on margin, which was satisfactory to them and we had the lion’s share of the margin. As we have grown internationally in more virgin territories, the bottles in the Coke system where we have transitioned or launched with, they have demanded a highest share of the value chain.
And this is something that we have had to deal with, understanding that if we want to launch in various countries internationally, that’s going to cost us more in margin than in the U.S., where we had a very established business and the Coca-Cola bottlers segued into this establish business with the same margins. We also have different costs impacts around the world, which we try to manage as best as we can.
And then one of the other issues that we are facing is that our juice products are doing very well. Our coffee products are doing very well and they themselves have lower margins than the traditional Monster beverages, which have, and of course, the diet has the best margin of all.
So, you have this issue of competing margins. However, there are things we can do with the juice products, we can establish greater efficiencies. We had a big improvement this year in this quarter in the U.S. In fact in freight getting product and raw materials to our co-packers, that was big benefit -- the other benefit that we had in the U.S. was in aluminum.
So there is a difficult range of factors that go into what the overall consolidated margin is. It is not just a simple one calculation. But we are working on it. And, as we have done in the U.S. and as we have done with freight in, we continue to look at our model internationally, and see where we can improve on our gross margin percentages. And as I have always said, Mark, we sell products and we make gross profit dollars. We don’t make gross profit percentages.
Rodney Sacks
I think that the only thing I would like to add to that is -- very briefly is that, in the international market, there are a lot of markets that we have had to traditionally shipped into many markets, so many countries from other countries.
We have -- and as we continue to expand and have sufficient volumes in countries, we are all switching to local production in those countries. We have opened up quite a number of additional production facilities in Europe this year and have got a number -- a large number going forward, and as we go forward, we think that will certainly help our margins internationally as well. But, at this point we just don’t think there is any numbers we can point you to.
Hilton Schlosberg
And also the community knows that we purchased REFILE, the concentrate facility from the Coca-Cola Company with the intention of producing ingredients in EMEA, which will reduce our improving efficiencies, improve costs and reduce the huge distances that we shipping these ingredients right now.
Rodney Sacks
Yeah. We will also address some of the challenges we had last year and a little bit this year even in out of stocks and where we have increased demand for particular products, we had very long lead times in order to ship ingredients to pack us to try increased volumes this will obviously improve those efficiencies and will help us going forward. So that’s been a -- we think we are very excited about the fact that that will help us in the whole of the EMEA and Middle East and Africa.
Operator
